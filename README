# Personalized Email Sender Script

This PowerShell script allows you to send personalized emails to a list of recipients using Microsoft Outlook. You can specify recipient data in an Excel spreadsheet, and the script will send emails with personalized salutations and optional attachments.

The PowerShell script to uses an Excel sheet for the receiving email addresses and add names to the email. To achieve this, you can use the Import-Excel cmdlet from the ImportExcel module if you have it installed. To install run the below script as administrator in PowerShell: Install-Module -Name ImportExcel

## Features

- Sends personalized emails to recipients from an Excel spreadsheet.
- Customizable email subject and body.
- Option to attach files to emails.
- Automatic pausing after sending a set number of emails.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Microsoft Outlook installed and configured on your computer.
- An Excel spreadsheet containing recipient information with columns for recipient name, email address, and attachment file paths (if needed).

## Usage

1. Edit the script to specify the path to your Excel file with recipient data (`$excelFilePath`).
2. Customize the email subject and body to meet your requirements.
3. If you have attachment files, ensure the file paths are correctly specified in your Excel sheet (use Column C for attachment paths).
4. Run the script using PowerShell.

## Example Excel Sheet

Here's an example of how your Excel sheet should be structured:

| Name      | Email               | Attachment Path         |
| --------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| John Doe  | john@example.com    | C:\Path\To\File1.pdf   |
| Jane Smith| jane@example.com    | C:\Path\To\File2.docx  |

The script will loop through the rows in your Excel sheet and send personalized emails to each recipient, using their name and email address. Attachments will be included if specified.

## Important Note

- Make sure to review and test the script thoroughly before sending emails to a large list of recipients to avoid any unintended actions.
